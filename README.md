#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Importance
-Enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g healthcare
-With increasing cyber threats, software engineering is vital in building secure systems and protecting sensitive data.
-


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Programming Language Development (e.g., Fortran, C)

Fortran (1957): 
 Its development clearly marked a serious movement away from machine-level programming to a much friendlier paradigm allowing more complex yet efficient problem-solving in the domains of science and engineering.

C (1972):
 The C programming language became a strong, flexible language that had immense influence on succeeding programming languages.Its development introduced important concepts, pointers, and memory management, but brought at the same time modular programming. This laid the base for many modern languages, including C++, Java, and Python.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

The 1960s were the time when the term "software engineering" was established as a discipline. During the NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany, in 1968, the need for a systematic approach to the development of software was strongly realized because of the increasing complexity of software systems. The growth of software engineering as a discipline brought more emphasis on structured methodologies, documentation, and good practice for managing and controlling the process of development. It was intended to solve the "software crisis" of these times, including issues like project delays, exceeding budgets, and unreliable software.

The Advent of Structured Programming in the 1970s

Structured programming was born in the 1970s as a programming paradigm that has been developed to enhance clarity in programs and decrease their relative complexity using structured control flow. It helped to cut down the risks of unstructured and chaotic code, hence making it more reliable, maintainable, and understandable. Structured programming has also had an impact on the development of later programming methodologies and languages, laying a base for modern software engineering practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning-This involves gathering and documenting user needs and requirements.
2. Design- Involves creating designs of the software architecture and user interfaces.
3. Implementation-This phase involves writing the actual code and building the software depending on the design specifications.
4. Testing- Involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment- Involves releasing the software to users/Customers
6. Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements after development.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall Methodology

-Has a Linear approach; each phase must be entirely completed before moving to the next phase: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.

Pros:
 Structure and milestones are very clear
 The process is very well-documented

Cons:
 Inflexible to changes
 Testing happens late in the development cycle, so issues are correspondingly found late.

Appropriate for: Well-defined and stable requirements of projects; for example, internal payroll system.

  Agile Methodology

It is an iterative, incremental approach with an emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and continuous feedback via short cycles (sprints).

Pros:
 • Adoption of changing requirements possible.
 • Frequency to deliver running software.

Cons:
 • Scope creep potential.
 • Less documentation.

When to use: In projects involving evolving requirements and frequent stakeholder feedback, like social media app development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs provide a comprehensive suite of tools for coding, debugging, and testing within a single interface, streamlining the development process.VCS track and manage changes to source code over time, allowing developers to see a history of modifications and revert to previous versions if necessary
Examples of IDEs
Visual Studio
Eclipse
Visual Studio Code
Examples of VCS
Git Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

 -Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies:
-Effective communication,
-Adopting agile methodologies,
-Prioritization of tasks
-Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  Importance in QA
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with and extract desired outputs from AI systems. 
Importance:
Improved accuracy


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Tell me about climate change."
Improved prompt: "Summarize the three main causes of global climate change since 1950 and their relative impact, citing recent scientific consensus."
The improved prompt is better for several reasons:

Specificity: The prompt limits the topic to causes of climate change rather than a broad topic.
Time frame: The phrase "since 1950" gives a clear temporal context.
Quantification: It asks for "three main causes," giving clear scope.
Depth: It requires the "relative impact" of these causes, which calls for a qualified response.

Source quality: By demanding "recent scientific consensus," it leads the AI to provide information that is right up-to-date and scientifically supported.

Structure: The prompt implicitly calls for a structured response to three causes and their impacts, which helps in the structuring of this information.

Conciseness: This improved prompt, although more detailed, still remains terse and clear about what it wants to ask for.
